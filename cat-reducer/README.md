# Context API

## Date: 11/20 W13 D3 D60

### Summary

There are four branches in this repo. The master branch is an in-class walk-through of working through the Context API. There are three additional branches that basically involve a refactor of yesterdays work except this time, using the Context API instead of Redux. 

There's definitely less of a cognitive load working with Context instead of Redux. There's less information to keep track of across the project.
