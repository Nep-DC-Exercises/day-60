# Redux Day 3 Context 

## Date: 11/19 W13 D2 D59

### Summary

There are several branches in this repo.

The master branch contains work we did together in class to get more familiar with React-Redux.

The  exercise 2 branch is slightly harder as we have to make use of the action payload. The user's form submission updates the global store causing an update in the component.

The exercise 3 branch is even more involved as the user has the ability to update the name and activity of each cat in addition to being able to add a cat to the global store.  I almost found myself prop drilling here but realized the whole point of Redux was to have a component be able to access to any of the actions in the application.

This activity was useful in not only learning react-redux but wrapping my head around controlled inputs regarding forms and breaking out functionality into separate components.
